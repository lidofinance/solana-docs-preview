# React Native

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import { themeLight, ButtonIcon } from '@lidofinance/lido-ui';
import DownloadIcon from './download-icon';

As we know `react-native` is frontend-based technology that helps create
native UI apps by Javascript. Respectively this sdk could be also simply run as any
other npm module (spoiler: not every module) inside `react-native` application.

Here will be instruction "How to integrate sdk to react-native?"

### Install

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm">
```

```bash
npm i @lidofinance/solido-sdk@latest
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">
```

```bash
yarn add @lidofinance/solido-sdk@latest
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Polyfills

There are some polyfills that are required for `react-native` engine, but we don't require them
directly in our code, they are required by our dependency `@solana/web3.js`, which most likely
you are already using. If not, please see [How to use @solana/web3.js in a React Native app](https://solanacookbook.com/integrations/react-native.html).
In short, you need to add two main polyfills:

- `react-native-url-polyfill`

URL.protocol is not implemented:
```bash
ERROR Error: URL.protocol is not implemented
ERROR Invariant Violation: Module AppRegistry is not a registered callable module
```

- `react-native-get-random-values`

`crypto.getRandomValues()` not supported:
```
Error: crypto.getRandomValues() not supported. See https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid#getrandomvalues-not-supported
```

Finally, after installing them, your code will be something like this:
```js
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
```


Also, you may get error [Canâ€˜t find variable:Buffer](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14796).
It should be enough to install [buffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer) and import it:

```js
import {Buffer} from 'buffer';
global.Buffer = global.Buffer || Buffer;
```

### Example

An [example React Native app](https://github.com/lidofinance/solido-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-native) that
demonstrates how to use the `solido-sdk` on `react-native` with interaction of a mobile wallet:

<video width="295" height="640" controls>
    <source src={require('../assets/example-demo.mp4').default} type="video/mp4" />
</video>


<a target="\_blank"  href={require('../assets/app-release.apk').default}>
    <ThemeProvider theme={themeLight}>
        <div style={{marginTop: 20, marginBottom: 20, width: 295}}>
            <ButtonIcon fullwidth icon={<DownloadIcon />} color="secondary" size="lg">
                Download .apk
            </ButtonIcon>
        </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
</a>

:::note
- The example is working only on Android, because [Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter) doesn't support IOS yet.
- Please use `@lidofinance/solido-sdk@`[0.8.0](https://github.com/lidofinance/solido-sdk/releases/tag/core%400.8.0) or above, because we made some specific optimizations & refactoring
that will be useful also for `react-native` applications.
